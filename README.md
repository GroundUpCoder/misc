Miscellaneous code snippets

Just some little programs that let me experiment with various APIs
and just see how things work.

Most of these are tested on MacOS, but will sometimes test on
other platforms as needed.

For the most part though, unless otherwise stated, these examples
should work with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), MacOS and Linux
environments in a straightforward way.
